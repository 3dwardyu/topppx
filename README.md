This is a simple app that utilizes the 500px API to allow users to see the
current popular photos on the site and allow users to like these photos if they
are logged in.

This app is built using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML and CSS.

The libraries/ gems used are follows:

* F00px - used to interact with the 500px API to make get and post requests along with sending keys to the API
* OmniAuth - used to authorize user to make specific requests to the API
* jQuery - used to call Justified Gallery
* Justified Gallery - used to organized photos from the get request in a grid
* Bootstrap - used for a simple navigation bar and styling
* Rspec - used for development testing to ensure controllers are working as intended

The app can currently be viewed on my personal server at http://138.197.0.19/
